        <h1>Introduction</h1>
      </header>
      <p>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.</p>
      <p>What is Python used for?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Data analysis and machine learning</li>
        <li>Web development</li>
        <li>Automation or scripting</li>
        <li>Software testing and prototyping</li>
        <li>Everyday tasks</li>

        <h1>Why is Python so popular?</h1>
      </header>
      <p>Python is popular for a number of reasons. Here's a deeper look at what makes it so versatile and easy to use for coders:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It has a <b>simple syntax </b>that mimics natural language, so it's easier to read and understand. This makes it quicker to build projects, and faster to improve on them.</li>
        <li>It's versatile. Python can be used for many different tasks, from web development to machine learning.</li>
        <li>Python's archive of modules and libraries—bundles of code that third-party users have created to expand Python's capabilities—is vast and growing.</li>
      </ul>

      <header>
        <h1>What types of jobs use Python?</h1>
      </header>
      <p>Since python is a general-purpose language, it's used across a variety of fields and industries. These are just a few job titles that may use Python:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Developer</li>
        <li>Data analyst</li>
        <li>Data scientist</li>
        <li>Cloud architect</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="hello-world">
      <header>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
      </header>
      <p>To get started with writing Python, open the IDE and write your first "Hello world" Python code:</p>

      <code>print("Hello World")</code>

    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="variables">
      <header>
        <h1>Variables and Types</h1>
      </header>
      <p>Python is completely object oriented, and not "statically typed". You do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare their type. Every variable in Python is an object.<br>
        This tutorial will go over a few basic types of variables.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="declaring-variables">
      <header>
        <h1>Declaring variables</h1>
      </header>
      <h3>Numbers</h3>
      <p>Python supports two types of numbers - integers(whole numbers) and floating point numbers(decimals). (It also supports complex numbers, which will not be explained in this tutorial). </p>

      <p>To define an integer, use the following syntax:</p>

      <code>myint = 7 <br>
        print(myint)</code>

      <p>To define a floating point number, you may use one of the following notations:</p>

      <code>myfloat = 7.0 <br>
      print(myfloat) <br>
      myfloat = float(7) <br>
      print(myfloat)</code>

      <h3>Strings</h3>
      <p>Strings are defined either with a single quote or a double quotes.</p>
      <code>mystring = 'hello'<br>
      print(mystring) <br>
      mystring = "hello" <br>
      print(mystring) 
    </code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="conditions">
      <header>
        <h1>Conditions</h1>
      </header>
      <p>Python uses boolean logic to evaluate conditions. The boolean values True and False are returned when an expression is compared or evaluated. For example:</p>
      <code>x = 2 <br>
      print(x == 2) # prints out True <br>
      print(x == 3) # prints out False <br>
      print(x < 3) # prints out True</code>
      <p>Notice that variable assignment is done using a single equals operator "=", whereas comparison between two variables is done using the double equals operator "==". The "not equals" operator is marked as "!=".</p>

      <h3>Boolean operators</h3>
      <p>The "and" and "or" boolean operators allow building complex boolean expressions, for example:</p>
      <code>name = "John" <br>
      age = 23 <br>
      if name == "John" and age == 23: <br>
      &nbsp print("Your name is John, and you are also 23 years old.") <br>
      
      if name == "John" or name == "Rick": <br>
      &nbsp print("Your name is either John or Rick.")</code>
      <h3>The "in" operator</h3>
      <p>The "in" operator could be used to check if a specified object exists within an iterable object container, such as a list:</p>
      <code>name = "John"  <br>
      if name in ["John", "Rick"]: <br>
      &nbsp print("Your name is either John or Rick.")</code>
      <p>Python uses indentation to define code blocks, instead of brackets. The standard Python indentation is 4 spaces, although tabs and any other space size will work, as long as it is consistent. Notice that code blocks do not need any termination.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="functions">
      <header>
        <h1>Functions</h1>
      </header>
      <h3>What are Functions?</h3>
      <p>Functions are a convenient way to divide your code into useful blocks, allowing us to order our code, make it more readable, reuse it and save some time. Also functions are a key way to define interfaces so programmers can share their code.</p>
      <h3>How do you write functions in Python?</h3>
      <p>As we have seen on previous tutorials, Python makes use of blocks.</p>

      <p> A block is a area of code of written in the format of:</p>


      <code>block_head:
          &nbsp 1st block line <br>
          &nbsp 2nd block line <br>
        ...</code>
      <p>Where a block line is more Python code (even another block), and the block head is of the following format: block_keyword block_name(argument1,argument2, ...) Block keywords you already know are "if", "for", and "while".</p>
      <p>Functions in python are defined using the block keyword "def", followed with the function's name as the block's name. For example:</p>
      <code>def my_function():
        &nbsp print("Hello From My Function!")</code>
      <p>Functions may also receive arguments (variables passed from the caller to the function). For example:</p>
      <code>def my_function_with_args(username, greeting):
        &nbsp print("Hello, %s , From My Function!, I wish you %s"%
      (username, greeting))</code>
      <h3>How do you call functions in Python?</h3>
      <p>Simply write the function's name followed by (), placing any required arguments within the brackets. For example, lets call the functions written above (in the previous example):</p>
      <code># Define our 3 functions
        def my_function():
        &nbsp print("Hello From My Function!")
        
        def my_function_with_args(username, greeting):
        &nbsp print("Hello, %s, From My Function!, I wish you %s"%(username, greeting))
        
        def sum_two_numbers(a, b):
        &nbsp return a + b
        
        # print(a simple greeting)
        my_function()
        
        #prints - "Hello, John Doe, From My Function!, I wish you a great year!"
        my_function_with_args("John Doe", "a great year!")
        
        # after this line x will hold the value 3!
        x = sum_two_numbers(1,2)</code>
